SlimJim is a Visual Studio solution file generator.

Current features:
* Create solution files for VS 2010 and 2008.
* Create solution file for one or more target projects in a file tree beneath a specfic root directory. Solution will contain:
** All projects that reference one or more of the target projects either by assembly or project reference and recursively each project refereced by those projects by project reference.
** All projects that the target projects reference by project reference and recursively each project refereced by those projects by project reference.
* Create solution file for working directory or specified projects root directory with either a specified or default name.
* Specify folder to contain generated solution files instead of projects root.
* Specifiy addition search paths outside of your project root to search for additional projects.

Upcoming features:
* .slim file in your projects root directory can contain details for generation of one or more solution files. This will allow for simple invocation, e.g. "C:\MyProjects>slimjim".
* Generate solution file for entire project graph.

Known issues: 
* If SlnOutputPath does not exist, an exception is raised.
* All paths must be absolute. Relative paths for additional search paths, projects root, and solution output path will be supported soon.
